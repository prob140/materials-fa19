    "### Conclusion ###\n",
    "What you have learned in this lab:\n",
    "- The `stats` and `special` modules of SciPy make it easy to compute probabilities numerically.\n",
    "- Counting isn't always as easy as 1-2-3; you have to be careful to avoid double counting or leaving out elements that should be counted.\n",
    "- Shapes of hypergeometric distributions can vary quite markedly depending on the parameters.\n",
    "- The joint distribution of two variables is simply a probability distribution over pairs of outcomes. Using it to find a probability works the same way as with one variable: identify the outcomes in the event and add up their chances.\n",
    "- Noticing symmetry and equality in distribution can reduce the amount of calculation needed."

    "## Submission Instructions ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Many assignments throughout the course will have a written portion and a code portion. Please follow the directions below to properly submit both portions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Written Portion ###\n",
    "*  Scan all the pages into a PDF. You can use any scanner or a phone using applications such as CamScanner. Please **DO NOT** simply take pictures using your phone. \n",
    "* Please start a new page for each question. If you have already written multiple questions on the same page, you can crop the image in CamScanner or fold your page over (the old-fashioned way). This helps expedite grading.\n",
    "* It is your responsibility to check that all the work on all the scanned pages is legible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Portion ###\n",
    "* Save your notebook using File > Save and Checkpoint.\n",
    "* Generate a PDF file using File > Download as > PDF via LaTeX. This might take a few seconds and will automatically download a PDF version of this notebook.\n",
    "    * If you have issues, please make a follow-up post on the general Lab 1 Piazza thread.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Submitting ###\n",
    "* Combine the PDFs from the written and code portions into one PDF.  [Here](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) is a useful tool for doing so. \n",
    "* Submit the assignment to Lab 1 on Gradescope. \n",
    "* **Make sure to assign each page of your pdf to the correct question.**\n",
    "* **It is your responsibility to verify that all of your work shows up in your final PDF submission.**"
