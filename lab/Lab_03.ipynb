    "Additivity is a powerful property of expectation: you have seen several examples in which writing a random variable as a sum of simpler variables has led to a simple calculation of its expected value. But other methods are needed for finding the expectations of random variables that can't easily be written as sums. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the basic definition of expectation is one such method, and it works well when you can easily write down the distribution of the random variable and have the computational tools to work out the resulting sum. However, distributions aren't always straightforward to write down.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is about expectations of a class of random variables that don't have natural representations as sums of simpler variables. These variables, called *order statistics*, can be thought of as the elements of a random sample arranged in increasing order. We will work with just two of them:\n",

    "- the median\n",

    "You have used the sample median as a statistic in Data 8. How big is a random sample median expected to be? By the end of this lab you will have an answer to this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding question for the sample mean has an easy answer by additivity: the expectation of a random sample mean is the population mean. But additivity isn't very helpful for medians as medians aren't easy to think of as sums. A different approach is needed.\n",

    "For expectations of random sample order statistics, the *tail sum formula* is an excellent approach if the values in the population are non-negative integers.\n",

    "* Please start a new page for each question. If you have already written multiple questions on the same page, you can crop the image or fold your page over (the old-fashioned way). This helps expedite grading.\n",

    "### Code Portion ###\n",
    "* Save your notebook using File > Save and Checkpoint.\n",
    "* Download the PDF file using File > Download as > PDF via LaTeX and confirm that none of your work is missing or cut off.  If the link leads you to a blank page, use [Command]+[S] or [Ctrl]+[S] to download your work.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting ###\n",
    "* Combine the PDFs from the written and code portions into one PDF.  [Here](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) is a useful tool for doing so.  \n",
